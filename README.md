# My C++ Solutions

These are my solutions to the exercises listed inside of Introduction to Programming with C++ (3rd Edition) International Edition by Y. Daniel Liang. I will not put the exercise problem for the related code since I do not have permission to put it here. If you have any code recommendations then leave a pull request. However please remember **I am not allowed to complete the program with code syntax I did not encounter in the book.** Therefore I cannot use loops in a solution before chapter 5.
